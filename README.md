# GovukElementsFormBuilder

To build GOV.UK based services you need to use [govuk_elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements) for presentation and [govuk_frontend_toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) for the interaction aspects.

This gem serves a form builder and other various helper methods to produces the markup required to leverage presentation and interaction without having to recreate the markup yourself.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile, form builder is the last gem in list:

```ruby
gem 'govuk_frontend_toolkit'
gem 'govuk_elements_rails'
gem 'govuk_elements_form_builder', git: 'https://github.com/ministryofjustice/govuk_elements_form_builder.git'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle
```

## Usage

In your application's `config/application.rb` file, configure the form builder to be the default like this:

```rb
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # ...
    ActionView::Base.default_form_builder = GovukElementsFormBuilder::FormBuilder
  end
```
